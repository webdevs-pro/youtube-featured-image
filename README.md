YouTube featured image for Gutenberg
====================================

This plugin automatically sets a post thumbnail from a YouTube video URL in the Gutenberg post editor.

The plugin will check YouTube maxresdefault.jpg first, if the video doesn't have a hi-res thumbnail, check sddefault.jpg and then hqdefault.jpg.

The plugin also scales and crops the uploaded image to 1280x720 (16:9 aspect ratio).

WARNING! To work with CPT, your CPT must have "custom fields" support.
